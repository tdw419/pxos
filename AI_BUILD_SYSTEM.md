# pxOS AI Build System

**Automated OS Development with LM Studio + Self-Expanding Pixel Networks**

This system uses AI to automatically generate, build, and improve pxOS by combining:

- **LM Studio**: Local LLM for code generation
- **Pixel Networks**: Self-expanding knowledge base that learns from each build
- **Primitive Generator**: AI that writes x86 assembly as WRITE/DEFINE commands
- **Automated Build Loop**: Iterative improvement system

---

## AI Response Format

All AI-generated primitives must conform to the `tools/ai_primitives.schema.json` schema. Free-form text is rejected. The generator will validate the JSON response and retry if it is invalid.

This ensures that the AI's output is always predictable and machine-readable, which is critical for a reliable automated build system.

## System Components

### 1. LM Studio Bridge (`pxvm/integration/lm_studio_bridge.py`)

A simple bridge to communicate with a local LLM running in LM Studio.

### 2. Python Cross-Compiler (`tools/pxpyc.py`)

A cross-compiler that translates a subset of Python into PXI Assembly IR. The AI can write pxOS programs in Python, and this tool will compile them into the JSON format that the build system understands.

### 3. IR-to-Primitives Compiler (`tools/ir_compiler.py`)

This script takes the PXI Assembly IR generated by `pxpyc.py` and compiles it into low-level pxOS primitives.

### 4. Automated Builder (`run_ai_build.sh`)

The main entry point for the AI Build System. This script orchestrates the new two-stage compilation process:
1.  **Python -> IR**: The `pxpyc.py` script is called to compile the high-level Python code into PXI Assembly IR.
2.  **IR -> Primitives**: The `ir_compiler.py` script is then called to compile the IR into low-level pxOS primitives.

This modular approach separates the language frontend from the machine backend, making the system more robust and extensible.
