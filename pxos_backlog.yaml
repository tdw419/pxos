    title: "Protocol Extension: Add Quantization Metadata Pixel"
    status: "done"
    type: "protocol"
    priority: "critical"
    notes: |
      Problem: Naive uint8 quantization causes saturation.
      Solution: Extend the Pixel Protocol to store float32 scale/offset metadata
      for each matrix.
      Implementation:
      - A 2-pixel block at (X=1, Row) and (X=2, Row) will store metadata.
      - (X=1, Row) R,G,B,A -> scale bytes 0,1,2,3
      - (X=2, Row) R,G,B,A -> offset bytes 0,1,2,3
      - Create pxvm/utils/quantization.py to handle packing/unpacking.

    title: "Integrate Quantization into Assembler and Interpreter"
    status: "done"
    type: "implementation"
    priority: "high"
    notes: |
      - Assembler: Calculate and pack metadata for each matrix.
      - Interpreter: Unpack metadata and dequantize data before operations.
      - Re-quantize results after operations.
